- ### [Datasets for Automatic Scoring of Educational Text Data](https://ltl-ude.github.io/EduScoringDatasets/)
- ### [ASAP-SAS by Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/asap-sas): It contains 10 prompts with around 2,000 answers per prompt. The average answer length of the prompts ranges from 26.5 to 66.2 tokens per answer. Broad prompt topics fall into three categories: Sciences (prompts 1, 2 and 10), English Language Arts (ELA; prompts 3, 4, 7, 8 and 9) and Biology (prompts 5 and 6). We use this topic information later to check whether training on a different prompt from the same topic is beneficial. The dataset contains scoring rubrics but no specific set of reference answers for the individual scores.
